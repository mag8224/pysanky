            <h2>Location of Requirements</h2>
            <p>The graphic created from scratch is the Rose symbol in the h1 heading on the homepage of this site (index.html)</p>
            <p>The embedded media is also on index.html it is the YouTube video that is click to play</p>
            <p>On index.html it the image with 3 eggs on it has the rollover effect to show a caption below it. </p>
            <p>Javascript was used on the designs (pattern.html) page to use a slideshow. This enhances the website functionality, because a user doesn't have to scroll through all the designs. Designs can also easily be added to the slideshow. </p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The three things that I think I did well for this project is making it responsive. As you make the window smaller, it changes the grid layout to be one column instead of two columns. Also at some points there are images removed which allow for easier readability.</p>
            <p>The second thing that I think I did well was have a good layout for the symbols page. I thought it made the most amount of sense to lay it out how it is. It gave the easiest amount of readability and a user can easily find dye meaning and symbol meanings. </p>
            <p>The last thing that was very good was that in addition to the slideshow Javascript on the patterns.html page, I added a printable pdf. This allows users to use the designs a lot easier if they were to use them for their own pysanky making. </p>
            <p>Two things I think I could have done better was had a different layout for the index page. It kind of seems all over the place, but at the same time there is a flow to it. Another thing I could have done better was the spacing on the steps page. There were some odd spacing due to the pictures that could have been fixed. </p>
