                    <p>Pysanky, pronounced "peh sahn key" are Ukrainian Easter Eggs. They are generally decorated around Easter time, and there is much symbolism behind them. They have been around for generations. There is also evidence that Pysanky were made in Pagan times and it was just taken from that culture and adapted for the Ukrainians and other Eastern Europeans. </p>

                        The word "pysaty" means to write. It is thought that you  are writing on the eggs rather than drawing. The reason behind the eggs are wishes and wants for the rest of the year. For example, if there is a waves or water representing symbols on the egg, this shows wishes for rain, no drought.

                        To create a pysanka, there are a series of diffrent steps to go through. They are made using wax, dye and a "pen" called a kistka. A kistka holds the wax and is held over a flame to melt the wax. The kistka then has a small hole in the bottom of it to allow the wax to flow out as it writes on the egg. Traditionally, and in modern times people who create pysanky use a wooden or plastic kistka. These must be manually heated as stated before. Just over 30 years ago, the electric kistka was invented. This is a kistka that plugs into an outlet or is battery powered. It keeps the metal section hot so that the wax automatically melts when placed into the melting section of it. Different people prefer the electric kistka over the traditional one and vice versa.

                        Pysanky can be kept for a very long time after they are made. During the process of creating pysanky, the inards of the egg is blown out to create a hollow shell. By emptying the egg it prevents it from rotting. The shell when cleaned properly will not carry a rotting egg smell. There have been times where the egg is not blown out. This is ok as well, as long as the egg shell never cracks. If the shell cracks, you will get the bad smell of sulfur. The standard dye used for the eggs is not food safe, so after finishing your own pysanky you can not eat the egg. There are food safe dyes to allow you to eat the egg after the fact, but after all the hardwork put into creating an egg, you won't want to break it.

                        The most common type of egg used in pysanky is a white chicken egg. These can be found and bought. They are large enough to have a good design, but small enough to work on in your hand without any assistance. Some other eggs that people use are quail eggs, goose eggs and ostrich eggs. Quail eggs are very tiny and require a fine eye. Goose eggs and ostrich eggs are very large and allow for a larger pattern to go on the egg.
